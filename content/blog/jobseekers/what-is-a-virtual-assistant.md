When I first started working  in 2007 as a freelance web designer and developer and sitting for hours on end on my computer, people around me including my family and friends thought that it was a waste of time. They believed in the concept go to a factory and work for 8 - 10 hours for 150 - 300 â‚¬ with a boss who follows your every move and just waits for your next mistake.

As a virtual assistant you have the freedom to escape the hamster wheel, daily comute to work, a demanding boss. As a virtual assistant you become an independent contractor chosing your own hours, services and rates.

Let me share with you my experience working as a freelancer and virtual assistant.

## So, what is a Virtual Assistant then?
A Virtual Assistant or also often called VA can be many things. It's a term used for an individual who is genarally self-employed and provides administrative, technical or social services for a business or individual online from a home office. As a VA you can focus on a specific niche like for example the outdoor industry.

My very first virtual assistant jobs were copywriting for a WordPress website, order and customer management, maintaining a coupon and Shopware website.

## What services do Virtual Assistants offer?
The beauty of the VA industry is that there are almost no limits to what work you can do online.

In 2014 I got my first virtual assistant job for bigger companies from Germany. My tasks ranged from order and complaint management, reservations, web design, call management, content creation, etc.

2017 I started working for a virtual assistant agency and got handed over 12 clients after a few days of my employment doing besides the mentioned tasks also social media management, data entry, research tasks, etc.
